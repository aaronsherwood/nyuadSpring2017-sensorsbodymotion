This version of the RF24 library (originally developed by J. Coliz, Jr., 
aka "ManiacBug") was updated by M. Pendrith <support@embeddedcoolness.com> 
to produce a version of the library that has been tested to work with the 
PJRC Teensy 3.x boards, for the convenience of customers of 
embeddedcoolness.com that have purchased the "RFX Teensy 3.x dev board w/ 
prototyping area and nRF24L01+ headers" carrier board.

This version of the RF24 library has been tested to work with Teensyduino 1.18, 
May 2014. The examples and library files have been rewritten where required so
that both ARM boards and AVR boards should be supported without further changes 
being needed.

For reference, all the orginal example and test sketches are included under 
"org" directories. The updated ARM-compatible versions of the sketches have a 
"2" appended at the end of the name (e.g., "GettingStarted2") to make it clear 
which version you are working with.

The library examples should all work with the Teensy 3.x connected to a 
nRF24L01+ module as per the embeddedcoolness.com RFX board pin assignments 
(i.e., HW SPI, IRQ = 2, CE = 3, CSN = 7).

The exception is the "pingpair_sleepy2" example. Note that this example sketch 
only works for AVR processor boards for now (equivalent ARM specific code yet 
to be added.) Also, the "native" test sketch for the LeafLabs Native Maple dev 
board hasn't been changed or tested with these library changes.
